Async - WIP, not even started.

This fork aims to bring preemptible bytecode execution for a non threaded, mono interpreter cpython running 
in the idle loop of a host.

first target will be Wasm cPython as built via https://github.com/pmp-p/pydk

-----------------------------------------------------
This is a pure-Python implementation of a Python bytecode execution virtual
machine.  I started it to get a better understanding of bytecodes so I could
fix branch coverage bugs in coverage.py.
